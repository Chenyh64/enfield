** The formal specification of the problem **

Let G=(V, E) be the physical qubit graph, where V is the set of qubits and
(u, v) in E means that the qubit 'u' can interact with the qubit 'v', and V' 
be a set of vertices such that V'!=V and |V'|=|V|. Also, let Q be a sequence 
of a set of interactions in P(V'xV') where 'qi' represents the i-th element 
of this sequence, such that 'i' in T={1..n}.

Consider these two functions:
- an initial mapping f:V'->V;
- a function g:T->P(V'xV').

For every (u,v)=qi:
- if (f(u),f(v)) in V, do nothing;
- else search for a path from f(v) to f(u) in the graph G. g(i) will be equal
  the swaps done at time 'i' so that f(v) is adjacent of f(u).

Notice that the swap operation creates a new function f:V'->V, so it must be
updated so that the new mapping function used is 'fi' ('f' at time 'i'). Also, 
for every time 'i', there can be a set of swaps, as the path can be greater 
than 2.

We want to find 'f' and 'g' such that it gives us the minimum number of swaps.
