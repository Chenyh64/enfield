D-wave machines:

- They are not quantum computers, but quantum annealers which are used
  to solve QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problems;

- The problem is to map each decision variable into a set of nodes of
  what they call a "Chimera graph" (which maps the connectivity among
  the physical qubits).

ScaffCC:

- ScaffCC: Scalable Compilation and Analysis of Quantum Programs
	-> Compiler for a quantum programming language called Scaffold
	   (Scaffold: Quantum Programming Language) and compiles classical
	   C code with this high-level C-based quantum programming
	   language.
	-> Compares two compilation types: pass-based and instrumentation
	   based compilation (which turns out to be faster).
	-> Applies some optimisations.
	-> Transforms the high-level code into QASM (not the same as
	   the IBM QASM, but not that different).
